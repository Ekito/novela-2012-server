	<h2>The project</h2>
	<h3>What is it?</h3>

	<img class="inline" src="@routes.Assets.at("images/novela.png")" />

	<p>For this year’s Novela, the artist Emmanuelle Mason, in association with the cutting-edge informatics company Ekito and their U.S. partner, Kaazing, will be be presenting a system which will allow visitors to participate in the creation of a gigantic composition, permanent and potentially infinite, collectively produced in the course of their movements, their pathways, their itineraries, journeys and so on.</p>

	<p>Joining in is a simple matter: all you have to do is to download the app <strong>Déambulations, 510,067,420km2 de dessin</strong> (for iPhone or Android), and to start it running. Once it’s been fired up, all of your movements are transmitted in real time to the internet site Déambulation at http://novela2012.ekito.fr, and will be visualized as a simple black line, along with those of all the other users of the app.
	<br>Together, all the different trajectories of the participants, recorded throughout the week, will create a huge composition, made up of hundreds, perhaps thousands, of individual journeys.</p>

	<p>The resulting drawing will be visible both on the site and on a giant screen displayed at the Matabiau railway station. You’ll be able to follow its expansion as it is being composed.</p>

	<h3>What's the Big Idea?</h3>
 
	<p>At the centre of this project is the question, often raised by contemporary artists, of the role of the spectator. Here there are no longer ‘spectators’, but participants, physically implicated in the creation of a work of art, playing out the idea, advanced by many contemporary artists, that it’s the spectator who makes the work. </p>

	<p>At the same time, we put modern graphic art in question, just as we did in the 18M3 project presented by our team last year. Here, Emmanuelle Mason, who has for some years placed draftsmanship at the centre of her practice, is not the author of a composition, but of a system, of a process, which allows the drawing to emerge and exist without her direct intervention. So it is that the work is a collective production, its authors at one and the same time creators and participants: the public. <br>
	Moreover, the composition develops out of the transmission of points (the users) on a plane (the city surface), which is the very definition of drawing. It brings together gesture and line, which are the essence of draftsmanship.</p>

	<p>We are also asking questions about representation: can we qualify a drawing as abstract if  it is, in fact, shaped by the tissue of roads, streets, railway lines and so on that criss-cross the territory? And the territory itself is an omnipresent question. Once the participant has downloaded the app and has decided to take part in creating the composition, she can walk down any street, drive along any highroad, take any train, subway, bus or pathway, limited only by the reach of worldwide GPS. Potentially, the drawing could cover the whole world, leaving only those spaces untouched by the networks of movement. So it is that the composition is shaped both by the movements of the participants and by the ways in which territory is sliced up by the various transportation networks, and by the virtual networks of GPS, GSM and wifi. Which brings us to the ways in which the individual journeys through public space, to the notion of personal pathways, intimate itineraries, private passageways across the commons. Each personal trajectory, the routes that we take each day to go to out into the city or back into the dwelling place, in our singularity, is in this way transcended by a trace which binds us all in, as if this drawing represented the mark of our linked destinies.</p>
 
	<h3>How’s it done?</h3>
	
	<p>From a technological point of view, this work is at the cutting edge of today’s research. Real time applications over the Internet are the high point of present innovations, offering enormous potential. What is more, we have here a collaborative aesthetic at work, a new of way of thinking about the world and of creating knowledge - in this case, art.</p>

	<h2>Who are the designers?</h2>
	<h3>The artist</h3>

	<p>Emmanuelle Mason’s artistic practice involves the exploration, the merging and the questioning of media which are, a priori, as different as drawing, video, apparatuses, performance, photography, sculpture, numeric production and dance.<br>
	Her work loos anew at the links between the work, its context, its creator, and the public, which latter becomes the work’s subject. Her work is often immersive and takes the form of apparatuses like 18M2 of drawing, exhibited at Novella 2011, which plunged the spectator into the middle of a sculpture/drawing created in space through the use of augmented reality glasses. Here works make manifest the link between art and life, placing the spectator at the heart of a sensory and spatial experience, both physically and mentally.<br>
	Since 2010, the artist has also been working on a series of compositions entitled “Stilled lives”. The series consists of some 30 small-format drawings, melded with photographs of small dead animals encountered in the daily round, printed numerically, drawn in ink or engraved. The animals, lying in a diaphanous fade-out, fascinate the spectator through their gentle dramas. In 2011, Ms. Mason attended several sessions of dissection and autopsy at the National Veterinary School in Toulouse. The images created during these sessions provided the starting point for a further series of five large drawings.</p>


	<h3>The technical creators</h3>

	<img class="inline" src="@routes.Assets.at("images/ekito.png")" />

	<p>Ekito, a local company, and Kaazing, a US company, are partners in developing HTML5 Websocket technology, giving real time access to large-scale data flows, via smartphones, browsers and so on. This revolutionary technology is one of the aspects of the future of HTML, and of user interactions on the internet. The founders of Kaazing are, in fact, the leading contributors to the HTML5 Websocket specification of the W3C.</p>

	<h3>Important information</h3>

	<p>The creators of this program wish to underline that your participation is completely anonymous, and that our aim is purely artistic. You yourself can determine when to allow your movements to contribute to the composition, turning the app on or off as you wish, exactly as you might pick up or lay down a pencil. Whenever you receive a phone call, the app will automatically power down, and, in any case, will never run in the background: it is only active when you yourself decide that it should be. At no time will you be asked to identify yourself, or to provide your telephone number. Your movement will be traced on the main composition, but neither the artist, nor Ekito, nor the festival organizers can link that trace to your specific telephone.</p>
